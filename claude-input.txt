Chronoscope Project - Lesson Plan Summary
Project Overview
Building Chronoscope, a web app for viewing and collaboratively creating timelines of historical events. Users can create "persons" and add events to them, with the ability to view multiple timelines side-by-side on a canvas.
Tech Stack

Next.js 15 (App Router)
React 19 with React Compiler
TypeScript
Tailwind CSS
Prisma ORM
Neon PostgreSQL
Radix UI (Dialog component)
pnpm package manager
Deployed on Vercel

Learning Philosophy
Incremental building - adding one concept at a time, with the student implementing code themselves rather than receiving complete solutions. Focus on understanding modern React/Next.js patterns encountered in daily professional work.
Completed Phases
Phase 1: Foundation ✅

Next.js 15 setup with App Router
TypeScript configuration
Basic data types (PersonData, HistoricalEvent, Canvas)
Simple timeline component with horizontal scrolling
Server Components basics

Phase 2: Multiple People on Canvas ✅

URL-based state (searchParams)
Displaying multiple people stacked vertically
Each person with their own horizontal event timeline
Understanding async props in Next.js 15

Phase 3: Creating People (CRUD Part 1) ✅

Server Actions introduction
Client vs Server Components distinction
Form handling without API routes
revalidatePath() for cache invalidation
In-memory data store (temporary)

Phase 4: Adding Events via Modal ✅

Radix UI Dialog component
Modal pattern (similar to X/Bluesky)
Scoped actions (adding events to specific people)
Hidden form inputs for passing context
Client-side state management with useState

Phase 5a: Share Button ✅

Clipboard API usage
Client-side URL manipulation
User feedback patterns (temporary "Copied!" state)

Phase 6: Database Integration ✅

Neon PostgreSQL setup
Prisma ORM implementation
Schema design (Person and Event models with relationships)
Replaced in-memory store with real database
Prisma Client usage in Server Actions
Prisma Studio for database visualization

Current Status
Just completed: Database integration is fully working. Users can create people and events through forms, data persists in Neon PostgreSQL, and everything displays correctly on the timeline.
Outstanding Tasks & Next Steps
Phase 5b: Canvas State + URL Sync (Deferred)
Not yet implemented - Added to backlog:

Client-side canvas state management
Syncing which people are visible with URL parameters
Add/remove people from canvas dynamically
Browser back/forward button support

Phase 7: Search Functionality (Next Priority)
Ready to implement:

Search UI component for finding existing people
Filter/query capability across all people in database
Click to add person to canvas
Integration with canvas state management

Phase 8+: Future Enhancements (Planned)

Form validation library (React Hook Form + Zod)
Timestamp precision for events (down to minute level)
Better ID generation (currently using simple slug generation)
Drag & drop for reordering events
Real-time collaboration features
Advanced styling and animations
Delete functionality for people/events
Edit functionality
Mobile responsiveness improvements

Key Concepts Covered

Server Components vs Client Components
Server Actions for form handling
Next.js App Router patterns
Async props and searchParams
Prisma ORM and database relationships
Type safety with TypeScript and Prisma
Modern form patterns without traditional API routes
Modal dialogs with accessibility (Radix UI)
URL state management

Design Decisions Made

Dark theme with blue accents
Dashboard layout: sidebar (300px) with forms, main area for timelines
Each person component has inline "+ Add Event" button (not global dropdown)
Using Neon instead of local SQLite for consistency between dev and production
No tRPC needed (Server Actions provide type safety)
Building components from scratch rather than heavy shadcn usage

Next Immediate Step
Implement search functionality to allow users to find and add existing people to their canvas view.
